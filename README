# Global Corruption Index 2023

Welcome to my project on the Global Corruption Index 2023. I am not an expert; this is an exploration of a dataset I found on Kaggle titled "Global Corruption Index 2023:Insights and Rankings". You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agungpambudi/global-corruption-index-transparency-perceptions).

## Project Overview

In this project, I focus on the following areas:

- **Regional Analysis:** I explored the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 2023 for the Americas (North, Central, South) and the Carribean. The analysis covers a total of 32 countries.

- **Historical Trends:** The dataset included CPI scores from 2012 to 2023, allowing for a longitudinal study of corruption perceptions over time.

- **Global Rankings:** I examined the global rankings of these 32 countries and their performance trends from 2012 to 2023.

This analysis aims to deepen the understanding of corruption trends in the specified regions and to give a better look at which countries in these regions are safe to do business in.
